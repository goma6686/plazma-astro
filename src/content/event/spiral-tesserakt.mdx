////////////////////////////////////////////

the Spiral Geometry

Theory, which is based on the unique concept of spiral energy and geometric

containment. Inspired by both metaphysical insights and scientific phenomena, this

theory proposes that the spiral is not just a natural pattern, but the default mechanism of

creation. It acts across dimensions to convert pure energy into matter, space, and light.

By identifying the spiral as the key organizational principle and proposing the tesseract

as the stabilizing geometry, this theory offers a fresh perspective on understanding both

visible and invisible phenomena in the universe, revealing the elegant and beautiful

design of the cosmos.
