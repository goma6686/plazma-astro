the Spiral Geometry 

Theory, which is based on the unique concept of spiral energy and geometric 

containment. Inspired by both metaphysical insights and scientific phenomena, this 

theory proposes that the spiral is not just a natural pattern, but the default mechanism of 

creation. It acts across dimensions to convert pure energy into matter, space, and light. 

By identifying the spiral as the key organizational principle and proposing the tesseract 

as the stabilizing geometry, this theory offers a fresh perspective on understanding both 

visible and invisible phenomena in the universe, revealing the elegant and beautiful 

design of the cosmos.
